## 📌 Abstract
**Stochastic Self-Closure (SSC)** is a proposed objective collapse theory that replaces the Observer with **Vacuum Tension**. It postulates that reality exists in an 8-Dimensional Phase Space Manifold and evolves via a "Stochastic Race" mechanism, minimizing entropy through geometric self-closure.

This repository contains the mathematical formalism (Syntax), philosophical interpretation (Semantics), and applied algorithmic demonstrations of the theory.

## ⚡ The Three Laws of SSC
1.  **Law I (Vacuum Tension):** Any divergence from vacuum equilibrium creates a tension field. This is the sole engine of causality.
2.  **Law II (Stochastic Race):** Probability collapse is an objective race. The path of highest conductivity (least resistance) becomes real instantly.
3.  **Law III (Structural Self-Closure):** Only systems that close the causal loop (minimizing local entropy) persist in time.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `/manuscript` - The full LaTeX source code of the monograph "Stochastic Self-Closure".
* `/simulation` - Python implementations of the **SSC Bell Test** (demonstrating geometric non-locality without signaling).

## 🛠️ Usage
To run the Non-Local Consistency Check (Honest Bell Simulation):
```bash
