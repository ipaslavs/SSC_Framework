By accessing or downloading the theoretical works (Manuscripts, PDFs, LaTeX source) in this repository, you agree to the following terms:

1. Attribution — You must give appropriate credit to the author (Ihor Paslavskyy), provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made (though changes to the theory are restricted by clause 3). You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.

2. NonCommercial — You may not use the material for commercial purposes (e.g., selling the book, putting the text behind a paywall).

3. NoDerivatives — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you may not distribute the modified material. The integrity of the Stochastic Self-Closure (SSC) theory must be preserved.
